simple libc tests based on the libc-testsuit of dalias
see http://git.etalabs.net/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi

build tests:
	cp Makefile.conf.def Makefile.conf
	# edit Makefile.conf
	make
run tests:
	./t

about the framework:

the only hook in the test framework is error(...) which
prints a formatted message and sets the test to failed
see common/test.h

in the root dir make builds an executable with all tests
in a src/* dir make builds only local tests
see Makefile.inc

a test function looks like
	void test_foo() {
		if (foo != 42)
			error("foo=%d expected 42\n", foo);
	}
extern functions with name ~ /^test/ are recognized to be
test functions
see Makefile.inc

edit the generated main.h to exclude certain tests
see common/main.c
