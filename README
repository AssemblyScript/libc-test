simple libc tests
based on the libc-testsuit and libc-bench of dalias
see http://git.etalabs.net/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi

build tests:
	cp Makefile.conf.def Makefile.conf
	# edit Makefile.conf
	make
run tests:
	./t
run benchmarks:
	./b

framework:

the only hook in the test framework is error(...) which
prints a formatted message and sets the test to failed
see common/test.h

in the root directory make builds an executable with all tests
in a src/* directory make builds only local tests
see Makefile.inc

a test function looks like
	void test_foo() {
		if (foo != 42)
			error("foo=%d expected 42\n", foo);
	}
extern functions with name ~ /^test/ are recognized to be
test functions
see Makefile.inc

a benchmark function looks like
	void bench_foo(int N) {
		for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
			foo();
	}
benchmark functions are repeatedly called with an increasing
N until the runing time is long enough, then time/N is printed

edit the generated tests.h to exclude certain tests
see common/t.c for tests
see common/b.c for benchmarks
