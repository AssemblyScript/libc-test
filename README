simple libc tests
based on the libc-testsuit of dalias
see http://git.musl-libc.org/cgit

build tests:
	cp dist/config.mak .
	# edit config.mak
	make
run tests:
	make run

framework:

the convention is that each test is in a separate file
at a path like src/directory/file.c with its own main

the test should return 0 on success and non-0 on failure

to simplify things there is a Makefile.inc that can
be included from src/directory/Makefile when the
above convention is used in src/directory
