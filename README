simple libc tests
based on the libc-testsuit and libc-bench of dalias
see http://git.etalabs.net/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi

build tests:
	cp dist/config.mak .
	# edit config.mak
	make
run tests:
	make t
run benchmarks:
	make b

framework:

the only hook in the test framework is error(...) which
prints a formatted message and sets the test to failed
see common/test.h

a test function looks like
	void test_foo() {
		if (foo != 42)
			error("foo=%d expected 42\n", foo);
	}
extern functions with name ~ /^test/ are recognized to be
test functions

a benchmark function looks like
	void bench_foo(int N) {
		for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
			foo();
	}
benchmark functions are repeatedly called with an increasing
N until the running time is long enough, then time/N is printed

see Makefile.inc for build system details
see common/t.c for test details
see common/b.c for benchmark details
